# Credit Default Prediction App

This app predicts whether a customer will default on their loan based on their personal and financial details. To use the app, upload a CSV file containing the customer data and click the "Predict" button to see the predictions and confidence levels for each customer.

The prediction model is built using the XGBoost algorithm, which is known for its high performance and accuracy in various classification tasks.

Please note that the accuracy of the predictions may vary depending on the quality and relevance of the input data. Always use the app with caution and consider additional factors before making any critical decisions.

To get started, simply follow the instructions below : 

1. Open your terminal (MacOS) or command prompt (Windows).
2. Navigate to the directory where the Streamlit app file (e.g., `app.py`) is located.
3. Make sure you have Streamlit and other required libraries installed. If not, run:
4. Launch the app by running the following command in the terminal: streamlit run app.py
5. A new browser window will open automatically with the app running. If it doesn't, copy and paste the URL provided in the terminal into your web browser.

Now you're ready to upload your CSV file and get predictions ðŸ™‚ !
